# Phone E-commerce Website


## Description

This is a full-stack MERN project which is an e-commerce website that sells cellphones. The website allows customers to see the detail and order phones, create an account and log in to see all the orders in the past. 

The application contains two basic roles:
  * Admins, they can manage all the products on the site, for example create, update or delete products. 
  * Users can search, select and order products, or they can even manage all the orders that they have purchased before.

Features:
  * Node provides the backend environment for this application
  * Express middleware is used to handle requests, routes
  * Mongoose schemas to model the application data
  * React for displaying UI components
  * Redux to manage application's state
